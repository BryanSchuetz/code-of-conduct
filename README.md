This is a bastardized re-working of the minimalist Lanyon theme for Jekyll, ported for use with [Siteleaf](http://siteleaf.com).

Includes configuration for use with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com), [Guard](https://github.com/guard/guard), and [POW](http://pow.cx).

If you're not familiar with Siteleaf, think of it as a web-based static site generator that's easy enough for your non-technical clients to use. 

**You build the templates, then let them manage the content in Siteleaf**, publishing out static files to FTP, SFTP, Amazon S3, Rackspace Cloud, Siteleaf hosting, or even Github Pages.

Developing for it is [super simple](http://vimeo.com/70121781). Templating is done with the delightfully easy to use  [Liquid](https://github.com/Shopify/liquid/wiki/Liquid-for-Designers) engine.

You can grab a copy of this template [here](https://github.com/BryanSchuetz/siteleaf-lanyon). To use it as is, just upload it to your theme folder in Siteleaf, and then follow the Site Setup directions below. To customize it further I suggest you look into setting up a [local development workflow](https://github.com/siteleaf/siteleaf-gem) with Siteleaf.
